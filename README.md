# Machine Learning Project - Tackling the Zillow Z-estimate

In my final year of university, I was tasked to work on the Zillow Z-estimate problem on Kaggle. It was a previously ended competition which lasted from 2017 to 2019, with monetary rewards for the winners.

My team had successfully designed a hybrid solution comprising of CatBoost and LightGBM (Light Gradient-Boosting Machine), which successfully ranked among the top 7% of submissions in the competition.
